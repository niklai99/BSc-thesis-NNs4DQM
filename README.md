# Predictive Learning applied to Muon Chamber Monitoring

## Overview

This work exploits neural networks to monitor the correct functioning of the detector over time by comparing the data
stream with a reference dataset.

## Code

All code is written in Python3. 

Usually, classes (upper case inital letter files) hold all the informations, scripts
(lower case initial letter files) do the job and Jupyter Notebooks are used to visualize results.
